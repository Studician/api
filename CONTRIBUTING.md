 # MyStudiez Contribution Guideline
The main purpose of this file is to help the larger community settle on some best practices when it comes to contributing.
Any help you give is greatly appreciated, big or small.
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Creating issues
We use GitHub issues to keep track of bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!
### Bug reports
Great bug reports tend to have:
- A quick summary of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce**
  - Be specific and give sample code if you can!
  - It is helpful to include the logcat message you're getting.
- What you expected would happen

Label, Milestone, and Project fields are going to be set by admins.

### Feature requests
Great feature requests tend to have:
- A short, meaningful title
- A great description of why it is needed

Label, Milestone, and Project fields are going to be set by admins.

## Contribution
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
Since we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html),
pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.\
To contribute:
1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `master`
2. Make changes
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
4. Update documentation, if needed
5. Ensure your code passes the tests
6. Issue that pull request!

Before contributing, I recommend everyone to read the [Code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\
**Any contributions you make will be under the same [GPL-3.0](/LICENSE) license that covers the project!**
